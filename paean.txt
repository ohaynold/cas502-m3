To Git, the Paragon of Version Control

O Git, thou art the muse of modern code,
A guardian where once chaos freely strode.
In Linus' mind, thy form did first ignite,
A tool to grant the coder's craft new flight.

RCS, of ancient days, did tread before,
A noble herald, yet with much to explore.
Its vision bound in simplicity’s embrace,
Yet left to time, it could not keep the pace.

Then Subversion came, a marked advance,
With branches fair and workflows to enhance.
But centralized, its single source was frail,
A fortress lost when storms of failure gale.

But thou, O Git, a revolution bold,
Distributed, thy tale of triumph told.
Each clone a mirror of the whole design,
Each coder sovereign, their commit divine.

Through thee, the merge is no more frightful chore;
Conflicts fade where once they raged before.
Thy branching swift, thy stash a saving grace,
Thy history traced with speed and subtle pace.

Linus, thy sire, the Linux lord of lore,
Who sought a way to make collaboration soar.
In weeks thou sprang from genius’ fertile land,
And won the hearts of coders 'cross the sand.

O Git, thy pull and push are seamless art,
Thy hooks a sign of systems built with heart.
Through thee, vast legions toil as one, not two,
Each line preserved, each change a story true.

Subversion fades in the bright glow of thy might,
And RCS rests as a memory of night.
But thou, O Git, shall reign in glory vast,
A beacon shining on a future cast.

So here we sing to Git and Linus bold,
Whose vision gave us treasures more than gold.
In thee, we trust, in thee, we iterate,
O Git, thou art the coder’s ultimate fate.
