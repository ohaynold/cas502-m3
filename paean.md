A Git-Saga of Glory
===================

Lo! We have heard of the might of *Torvalds*,  
He who wrought wonders in the land of code.  
In the shadow of **Linux**, his labor unfolded,  
A gift to the makers, a tool for their craft.  

Long were the days when coders struggled,  
Bound by the chains of **RCS**'s design.  
Single files guarded, history splintered,  
Its grasp was feeble, its spirit waning.  

Then rose **Subversion**, swifter, more cunning,  
A warrior stronger than its faded forebear.  
Yet still it faltered, a lone and fragile lord,  
Its castle of code had but one sacred heart.  
A single failure could bring ruin to all—  
Its power limited, its fate foretold.  

Then sprang forth **Git**, born of *Linus*’s wisdom,  
A mighty weapon, forged in swift weeks.  
Distributed it stood, a fortress in fragments,  
Each clone a kingdom, each coder a king.  

Branches did flourish like limbs of an ash tree,  
Merges came smooth as a ship on calm seas.  
No longer did warriors fear the clashing of edits,  
For **Git** stood mighty, resolving all strife.  

Faster than thought, it hunted through history,  
Tracing each change, each deed carved in time.  
With every commit, a saga was written,  
A tale of the makers, their toil, and their triumphs.  

*Linus*, the smith, in his forge of genius,  
Brought forth this marvel to bind us as one.  
He saw the flaws of the tools of old,  
And cast them aside, creating the new.  

**RCS** lies buried, its deeds remembered,  
A relic of the past, its battle long done.  
**Subversion** yet lingers, a shadow of **Git**,  
Though strong in its time, its glory has waned.  

But **Git**, O **Git**, thou art unmatched!  
Thy pull and push are the winds of the sea,  
Thy branching the roots of the yew-tree vast,  
Thy might eternal, thy purpose clear.  

Now sing we the praise of *Torvalds*, the maker,  
The Lord of Linux, the master of **Git**.  
For through his wisdom, the coders are free,  
And their labors endure, their legacies strong.  

So shall it be, while code is written,  
While projects are born, and histories made.  
**Git** shall endure, the hero of systems,  
And *Linus* remembered, the giver of light.
